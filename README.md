## Learnings

In developing the "Sushiman" project, I was able to improve my CSS skills and learn how to use the animation library to. I faced challenges by synchronizing animations with the user's scroll and creating a responsive image gallery that kept a quick performance. In addition, making the responsive landing page on different devices was an additional challenge that required me to explore flexible layout techniques and adapt visual elements. In the end, this experience not only resulted in a visually attractive landing page, but also boosted my growth as a developer.
